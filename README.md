# iTeeSysLog
Collect syslog from your router, etc

It is a really simple small c# application to collect SNMP logs from your router or other network log compatible device.
I wrote it especially to collect OpenWrt logs for a special purpose, so it contains some filtering logic.

Feel free to reuse any part of the code.
